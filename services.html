        <h1>My Services</h1>
        
        <h2>Revenue Operations</h2>
        <p>
            I specialize in aligning sales, marketing, and customer success operations to create a seamless 
            revenue-generating engine. My experience spans <strong>CRM optimization, sales automation, pipeline forecasting</strong>, and 
            improving lead-to-customer conversion processes. I have deep expertise in <strong>Salesforce and RevOps tech stacks</strong>, 
            ensuring teams have the data and tools they need to operate efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have led RevOps for <strong>high-growth SaaS startups</strong>, scaling from <strong>Series B to Series D</strong>, and have built 
            <strong>end-to-end revenue processes</strong> from the ground up. Whether you need <strong>dashboarding, analytics, workflow 
            automation, or a full CRM revamp</strong>, I can help streamline your operations and drive scalable growth.
        </p>

        <h2>Business Operations</h2>
        <p>
            I help companies <strong>optimize internal processes, automate workflows, and implement best-in-class operational systems</strong>. 
            From <strong>billing automation and contract workflows</strong> to <strong>access control and compliance</strong>, I bring a structured 
            yet flexible approach to scaling operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            My experience includes <strong>Google Workspace admin, CRM security, data governance, and process automation</strong>. 
            I love turning <strong>inefficient manual tasks into streamlined, automated workflows</strong> that reduce overhead and 
            free up teams to focus on meaningful work. If your company is struggling with <strong>data silos, inefficient workflows, 
            or security concerns</strong>, I can help.
        </p>

        <h2>Software Development</h2>
        <p>
            In addition to operations, I am an <strong>iOS and software developer</strong>, working on projects that blend business logic 
            with <strong>user-friendly applications</strong>. I have experience building <strong>mobile apps, backend systems, and API integrations</strong> 
            to help businesses automate, optimize, and extend their capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            My focus is on <strong>business automation, AI-driven solutions, and custom integrations</strong>. Whether you need 
            an <strong>internal tool, a customer-facing app, or an API integration</strong>, I can help design and develop solutions that 
            fit your needs.
        </p>

        <h2>Consulting Availability</h2>
        <p>
            I am available for <strong>fractional, project-based, and advisory consulting engagements</strong> for startups and growth-stage 
            companies. Whether you need <strong>RevOps strategy, business automation, CRM implementation, or technical consulting</strong>, 
            I can provide <strong>hands-on execution or high-level strategic guidance</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>

            specific needs. If you're interested in working together, feel free to <strong>reach out via my contact page</strong>.
